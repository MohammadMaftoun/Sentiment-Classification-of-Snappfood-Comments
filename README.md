This project focuses on classifying the sentiment of user comments on Snappfood, one of the largest online food delivery platforms in Iran.

This repository contains a complete pipeline for sentiment classification of Persian-language comments collected from Snappfood, one of Iranâ€™s leading online food delivery services.
